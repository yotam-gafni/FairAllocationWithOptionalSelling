# Lemma 9: a canonical partition exists at every step of the main loop

This file assembles the proof of the manuscript's Lemma 9 out of the two halves developed in
`RequestProject.TwoThirdsBudget` (the accounting: how much value a still-active agent has at its
disposal, and what each loss event costs it) and `RequestProject.TwoThirdsDescent` (the
combinatorial descent, which ends in Proposition 6).

The bridge between them is the classification `eventCost_witness`: every loss event either costs
at most the threshold `ρ·MMSᵢ = 2ε` — a *cheap* event — or it can be charged to one single good
that it removed from the pool and that lies in a part of the agent's equi-valued MMS partition —
a *charged* event, whose cost is at most `v̄(witness) + ε` and at most `μ = 3ε`.  Since the goods
removed by distinct events are distinct, the witnesses of distinct charged events are distinct,
which is exactly the configuration the descent consumes.

/-- **Lemma 9.**  For `ρ = 2/3`, a canonical partition exists at every step of the main part of
the algorithm: the active agent `i` of highest maximin share can partition the available goods and
money into `|T|` parts that are all acceptable to it and that satisfy the three canonicity
conditions.

The hypothesis `hmax` (agent `i` has the largest maximin share among the active agents) is the
one the manuscript states; the formal proof does not use it, because the consequence the
manuscript draws from it — the lower bound `μ − t ≤ p f` on the price of a good sold in a round —
is already part of the definition of the loss types `ℓ₃` and `ℓ₄` (see `LossL3`). -/

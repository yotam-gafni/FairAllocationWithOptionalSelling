# The matching step of the `2/3`-MMS algorithm

This file contains the combinatorial heart of the matching phase of the manuscript's
Algorithm 1 (`APX-MMS-2/3`), in a form that is independent of the fair-division model.

The manuscript describes the matching phase as follows: build the bipartite graph `G` between
the active agents other than the proposing agent `i` and the non-special parts of the canonical
partition, with an edge whenever the agent finds the part acceptable; if `G` has a perfect
matching, use it; if `G` has no edge, give an arbitrary part to `i`; otherwise use Hall's theorem
to match a set of parts to a set of agents so that *no unmatched agent finds a matched part
acceptable*, and repeat on the remaining subgraph.

**An issue with the manuscript's description.**  The iteration described in the manuscript need
not terminate, and the intermediate claim it makes is not always achievable.  Take two agents
`a₁, a₂` and two parts `b₁, b₂`, where both agents accept `b₁` and neither accepts `b₂`.  There
is no perfect matching, and the graph does have an edge, so we are in the third case; but every
non-empty matching matches `b₁`, and then the other agent — which is unmatched — does find the
matched part `b₁` acceptable.  Hence the only admissible matching in the third case is the empty
one, which leaves the graph unchanged and the iteration loops forever.

What is true, and what the analysis actually needs, is the statement proved here
(`exists_closed_matching`): there is a set `K` of agents matched injectively to acceptable parts
such that no agent outside `K` accepts a matched part, and *in addition*, if `K` is not all of
the agents, one can point to an unmatched part `b` that no agent outside `K` accepts — this is
the part that gets handed to the proposing agent `i`, and the analysis needs precisely that the
remaining active agents find it unacceptable.  In the example above the lemma returns `K = ∅`
and `b = b₂`, which is the correct behaviour of the algorithm.

The proof is by induction on the number of agents, using Hall's theorem (Mathlib's
`Finset.all_card_le_biUnion_card_iff_exists_injective`) in the case where Hall's condition holds,
and recursing on `A \ X`, `B \ N(X)` for a violating set `X` otherwise.

/-- **The matching step.**  Given a set `A` of agents, a set `B` of parts with at least as many
parts as agents, and an acceptability relation, there are a set `K ⊆ A` of agents and an
injective assignment `f` of parts of `B` to them such that

* every agent of `K` accepts the part assigned to it;
* no agent of `A \ K` accepts any part assigned to an agent of `K`;
* either every agent is matched (`K = A`), or there is a part of `B`, unassigned, that no agent
  of `A \ K` accepts. -/
